## What is this?
This project written in JavaScript is used to visualize the temperature and humid of the weather with the data chart using React-vis library and the data table. The [data](https://hidden-waters-43067.herokuapp.com/tasks) is taken and processed by NodeMCU and RestfulAPI with MLAB Database.

Additionally, this project includes the Machine Learning to forecast the weather. However, the machine learning part hasn't been built completely then we decided not to public.

## How to run
1. Open Terminal and install the required packages by using the command line:

>npm install

2. Run the program with the command line:

>npm run start
